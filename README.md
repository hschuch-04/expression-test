## Introduction
The Expression Test is a mobile application where the user has to answer a series of visual questions to help improve their ability to recognise facial expressions. This is based on Dr Paul Ekmans' work in expressions/micro-expressions. 

This is my first Flutter application to develop skills with Routes, Styling, Widgets, Stateless/State, etc...

 ## The Stack
The Expression Test was developed using Flutter and does not have any proper backend to the project, with the images stored in a local assets folder and using object variables which have the questions and result scores stored.

 ## Development Experience
Developing the application took some time to understand how I would do routing between the quiz pages, however I decided to change the individual page with different images/answers as they are the same layout so no navigating was required. This allowed for a simpler development app structure, where it's mainly components on a singular page.

I decided to store the information in Object variables locally with images to keep the project simple for myself due to my first proper project.
